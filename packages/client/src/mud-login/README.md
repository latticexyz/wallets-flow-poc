TODO

- figure out how to not clobber global styles with radix ones
- different paymasters with different behavior
  - diff addresses per paymaster
  - diff ways to top up paymaster
  - detect balance of each, use priority list or highest balance?
  - "top up" should have its own set of "requirements" like the global login does
